# Uhh Yeah Timestamps

Uhh Yeah Timestamps is a repository of episodes linking to clips of one of my favorite podcasts, [Uhh Yeah Dude](https://uhhyeahdude.com/).

Users will be able to add, edit, and delete timestamps to their favorite moments of (almost) every episode of the show, and others can vote them up. The media CSS currently utilizes [Picobel](https://github.com/tomhazledine/picobel).
